There are 3 ways in which you can send integrate your scrapers with Scraper API:

1. API endpoint: `http://api.scraperapi.com/?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY&url=http://httpbin.org/ip`
2. One of our SDK's, currently available for: [Python](https://pypi.org/project/scraperapi-sdk/), [NodeJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/scraperapi-sdk), [PHP](https://packagist.org/packages/scraperapi/sdk), [Ruby](https://rubygems.org/gems/scraperapi), [Java](https://github.com/scraperapi/scraperapi-java-sdk).
3. Proxy Port: `http://scraperapi:YOUR_API_KEY@proxy-server.scraperapi.com:8001` 

All three options have the same functionality and performance, they just offer you the flexibility to integrate Scraper API in the way that is easiest for you.
